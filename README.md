base_python_skeleton
====================

Basic Structure For a Python Project

You can simply download the zip file of the latest commit here: https://github.com/idjaw/base_python_skeleton/archive/master.zip

Once unzipped, you just need to make sure you have virtualenv installed:
pip install virtualenv

Navigate to the root of the base_python_skeleton:
cd %YOUR_PATH%/base_python_skeleton/
virtualenv venv

you should now have a venv directory created. The base is built assuming a virtualenv named venv is created. If you use a different name other than venv, make sure you modify the settings.py file in settings/settings.py.
